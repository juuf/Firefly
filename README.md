# Fireflies for Bela 
Adapted version of https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6981832, in order to use it in Belas.  <br />
To get an overview, run the "run" files in the m-files folder. <br />
The file "fireflySimulation4.m" is the one which is then ported to C++ synchronising to an external signal "phi_ext" (see c-files folder). <br />
In order to make it work with Belas, some further steps need to be taken which are sketched inside the Bela-folder.
