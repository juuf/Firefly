# Fireflies for Bela 
Adapted version of https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6981832, in order to use it in Belas. 
To get an overview, run the "run" files in the m-files folder. The file "fireflySimulation4.m" is the one which is then ported to C++ synchronising to an external signal "phi_ext".
In order to make it work within Belas, some further steps needs to be taken which are sketched inside the Bela-folder.
