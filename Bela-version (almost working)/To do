- Call of function needs to properly implemented, and decided which value to send to PD in order to elicit a tone. 
- Besides that, also the audio input from the microphone needs to be implemented.
- For now, an interal firefly/signal "phi" synchronises to an external signal "phi_ext" which cannot adapt,
such that the internal signal adpats its frequency to the external fixed frequency. Therefore, as a first step 
this setup can be used without the need of an external audio input from the microphone.
